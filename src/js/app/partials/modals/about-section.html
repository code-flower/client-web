<div class="about-content">

  <p>It's a git repository, represented as a <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-force" target="_blank">d3 force-directed graph</a>.</p>

  <p>The inner nodes correspond to the folders in the repo, and you should find the root of the repo somewhere near the center of the graph.  The outer nodes correspond to the files in the repo. The radius of the outer nodes is proportional to the number of lines of code in the files, as determined by the <a href="https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc" target="_blank">cloc</a> program, and their color is determined by the language in the files.</p>

  <p>If you hover on the visualization, you can see the folder and file names, as well as the number of lines of code in each folder or file. Hovering on the table will highlight the files in the language you're hovering on. And you can use the "folder" dropdown to focus on subfolders within the repo.</p>

  <h4>How the app works</h4>

  <p>When you enter a git clone url, the repo is cloned on a <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node</a> server. The repo is then analyzed using <a href="https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc" target="_blank">cloc</a>, the output of which is converted to a JSON object that determines the structure of the vizualization. Throughout this process the events on the server are broadcast to the client over a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API" target="_blank">Websockets</a> connection, and displayed in the faux terminal.</p>

  <p class="hide-if-single-repo">Once the client receives the JSON, it stores the data in a client-side document store called <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API" target="_blank">IndexedDB</a> (which you can see in the Application tab of Chrome's devtools). This method enables the app to persist significant amounts of personalized data without the need for user accounts, or any server-side or cloud-based storage.</p>

  <p>The front end is written in <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">Angular</a>, but with a <a href="http://redux.js.org/" target="_blank">Redux</a>-inspired architecture that emphasizes unidirectional data flow and careful control over application state.</p>

  <h4>Credits</h4>

  <p>Tons of credit to <a href="http://www.redotheweb.com/" target="_blank">Fran&#231;ois Zaninotto</a>, who figured out that cloc output could be used to generate a force-directed graph, and wrote the original <a href="https://github.com/fzaninotto/CodeFlower" target="_blank">CodeFlower</a> vizualization in d3.</p>
