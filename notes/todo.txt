CLIENT
  - what to do about prefs section?
    - maybe add some sliders and such to tweak the gravity, springiness of the viz?
  - make a better architectural diagram
  - improve readme
  - it may not be necessary any more to add the color to the node elements, just use the classes
    - that way it wouldn't even to redraw when you switch colorSchemes
  - changing the color scheme should not automatically change the current folder to root
  - at the top of flower-languages, add name of repo as a link to the repo
  - add number of files to the list of folder paths in parens
    - for large repos, choose the first folderpath with less files than a threshold, notify user that you're doing so
  - maybe add a max-height to the languages table and have it scroll

SERVER
  - try to break the server with weird urls and such
  - aborting should kill the process immediately rather than waiting until the end and then deleting

BUILD/DEPLOY
  - deploy to aws w/codedeploy, S3, Jenkins, Elastic Beanstalk

CHROME EXTENSION
  - pros
    - button in browser makes access easy
    - the static files are saved in the user's harddrive
      - so no strain on the server from serving those files
      - and the app will work offline
    - don't have to worry about cross-browser issues
    - no real need to minify stuff for performance reasons
  - cons
    - harder to automate the deployment of new versions
      - but check out https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/using_webstore_api
    - user has to install the app on the chrome store

VISUALIZATION
  - change 'root' to '/'
  - check out http://graus.nu/d3/ for zoom function

GIT FUNCTIONALITY
  - look at visualizing git history
  - encryption of credentials?

DEPLOYMENT
  - need an install script that:
    - installs git, cloc and forever on a linux-like server
      - npm install -g cloc works
    - clones the repo
    - runs node forever
