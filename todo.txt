ENVIRONMENT
  - need browsersync
  - browserify to bundle everything
  - build process that bundles and minifies everything
    - alternate builds:
      1. regular build
      2. chrome extension build that includes manifest and background.js

EXTENSION
  - need to figure out how to prevent multiple tabs from opening when you click multiple times
  - need icons

VISUALIZATION
  - map colors to file types?
  - change 'root' to '/'
  - check out http://graus.nu/d3/ for zoom function

UI
  - implement update button
    - just delete the repo in the DB followed by a new clone
  - need a way to cancel a clone/update in the UI
    - maybe toggle on an 'Abort' button when clone/update is happening
  - need a credits section
  - deal with case where all repos are deleted
  - upgrade to Angular2?

FAUX TERMINAL
  - use websockets instead of event source 

GIT FUNCTIONALITY
  - add way to track private repos
  - look at visualizing git history

SERVER
  - modularize the server code
  - figure out why cloc is ignoring certain files
  - can probably delete repos and cloc data after analysis (also change path)
