PRIORITIES
  1. private repo access
    - need to turn credentials prompt into a modal
    - need to return an error message in the same modal if credentials prove invalid
      - this will also require a catch block in analyzeRepo so that SSE can emit: 'UNAUTHORIZED' in
      the event that credentials are submitted but don't work
  2. convert stream to websockets
  3. need better build process

ENVIRONMENT
  - need browsersync
  - browserify to bundle everything
  - need sass
  - build process that bundles and minifies everything
    - alternate builds:
      1. regular build
      2. chrome extension build that includes manifest and background.js

EXTENSION
  - need to figure out how to prevent multiple tabs from opening when you click multiple times
  - need icons

VISUALIZATION
  - map colors to file types?
  - change 'root' to '/'
  - check out http://graus.nu/d3/ for zoom function

UI
  - implement update button
    - just delete the repo in the DB followed by a new clone
  - need a way to cancel a clone/update in the UI
    - maybe toggle on an 'Abort' button when clone/update is happening
  - need an about section
  - need a credits section
  - deal with case where all repos are deleted
  - upgrade to Angular2?
  - handle case where user tried to clone a repo that's already in the DB
    - probably just treat it as an update, i.e., delete the entry in the DB and clone anew

FAUX TERMINAL
  - use websockets instead of event source 

GIT FUNCTIONALITY
  - look at visualizing git history

CLOC
  - make reasons.txt available in the client

SERVER
  - figure out why cloc is ignoring certain files
