PRIORITIES
  1. clean up server code
  2. eliminate server-side storage and delete serveRepos
  3. delete repos and cloc files after converting to JSON
  4. delete JSON after serving it
  2. private repo access
  3. convert to websockets
  4. need better build process

ENVIRONMENT
  - need browsersync
  - browserify to bundle everything
  - need sass
  - build process that bundles and minifies everything
    - alternate builds:
      1. regular build
      2. chrome extension build that includes manifest and background.js

EXTENSION
  - need to figure out how to prevent multiple tabs from opening when you click multiple times
  - need icons

VISUALIZATION
  - map colors to file types?
  - change 'root' to '/'
  - check out http://graus.nu/d3/ for zoom function

UI
  - implement update button
    - just delete the repo in the DB followed by a new clone
  - need a way to cancel a clone/update in the UI
    - maybe toggle on an 'Abort' button when clone/update is happening
  - need an about section
  - need a credits section
  - deal with case where all repos are deleted
  - upgrade to Angular2?

FAUX TERMINAL
  - use websockets instead of event source 

GIT FUNCTIONALITY
  - add way to track private repos
    - see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22755268/clone-a-private-repo-of-github-with-username-and-password
      - git clone https://username:passwordgit@github.com/*****/******.git
  - look at visualizing git history

CLOC
  - make reasons.txt available in the client

SERVER
  - modularize the server code
  - figure out why cloc is ignoring certain files
  - can probably delete repos and cloc data after analysis (also change path)
